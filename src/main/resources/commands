Spring Boot can automatically create the schema (DDL scripts) of your DataSource. Following are the steps taken to make it work with Flyway
1. Comment out the flyway dependency and any flyway dependent class so that Hibernate's schema creation strategy takes preference
2. Make sure that property spring.jpa.show-sql=true
3. Note down all the hibernate statements from the logs for schema creation and modify them such that each statement can be run independently
4. Copy all those sql statements in V2.1__xxx.sql
5. change the url of the database to a different DB in property file so that flyway creats a new DB and schema and any other sql you want to run
6. run the project and look H2 console.
